This project is a web app that consumes info from a RESTful API called  [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/). The functionalities are the following:

- In the option *Pokemon list*, the application shows a table with general information about different Pokemon, among which are: ID, name, generation and color;
- At the top of this table, there is a filter that allows you to search for Pokemons by name. For example: If I type *chu* , the table will show me Pikachu and Raichu as a result;
- Finally, the download button allows us to download more detailed information about each pokemon in a .txt file.;

Download and try it out! 

**Important**: Make sure you have the ASP.NET and web development installed.
